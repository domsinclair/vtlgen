# Vtl Data Generator

This is the repository for the Data Generator.  If you opt to download it from here then download it as a zip file, extract it to your computer, rename the extrated folder to vtlgen and add that to your Trongate Modules directory.

Alternatively you can obtain it from the module market via the Trongate desktop app.
